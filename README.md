**Game of Black jack, a popular casino card game where players compete against the dealer,**


**not against each other.**
    
The primary goal is to have a hand total that is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand, without going over 21.
    
**Basic Rules:**
    
- Card Values:
- Numbered cards (2-10) are worth their face value.
- Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are all worth 10.
- Aces can be worth either 1 or 11, depending on which value helps the hand most without going over 21.
    
**Gameplay:**
- Both the player and the dealer are dealt two cards. One of the dealer's cards is face up (the "upcard"), and the other is face down.
    
      
- Players then decide whether to "Hit" (take another card) to get closer to 21, or "Stand" (keep their current hand) if they're satisfied. Other options like "Double Down" or "Split"       may also be available.
      
- If a player's hand goes over 21, they "Bust" and automatically lose.
